Hello (name)! Based on the fact that you wake up at __(wakeTime)__, we recommend you are in bed by _(bedtime)__ o'clock.
Finish your dinner by _(bedtime, minus 2)_ o'clock, and no late night snacking!
By _(bedtime minus 1)_, make sure you have turned off all electronics. TV, cellphones, and computers all emit a blue light that restricts the production of melatonin in your brain, which helps put you to bed at night.
(if caffiene is true) We do not recommend caffiene before bed. In order to receieve the best sleep quality, you should quit any caffiene consumption by _(bedtime minus 6)__ o'clock.
(if caffiene is false) ---null---
(if exercise is true) Great job exercising! The more your mind and body are exercised during the day, the more restful sleep you will have. However, working out immediately before bed can make it harder to wind down at the end of the night. Try to finish your workout by _(bedtime minus 3)__ o'clock.
(if exercise is false) If you want to improve your sleep quality, exercising is a great way to do it. It tires out your muscles and makes you sleep harder and longer through the night. Consider doing a few pushups and situps every morning, and your body will thank you for it!
The most important part of creating good sleep hygiene is maintaining a regular schedule. The more regular your schedule it is, the easier it is for your body to fall asleep at the time you want it to. You'll be amazed how much more produtive your days are once you have a full 8 hours of deep sleep!

Example tips:
use night shift on your phone to block blue light
