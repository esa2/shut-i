        <h4>About the Creators</h4>
        <p class="bold">Adam Wittnam</p>
        <p>I grew up in a small town in southern Illinois.  Moved to south Texas and did 10 years at a Fortune 200 company, more specifically in their Wealth Management Company.  After marrying my Active Duty wife, I transitioned to a stay-at-home dad.  We've now decided to permanently stay in the Seattle area and for me to change careers and move into the Dev world.  Aside from being a semi-pro beardsmith, I can also be found in the woodshop turning wood.</p>

        <p>I like rocks, kids, and dogs. Not necessarily in that order.</p>

        <p>I grew up in the Midwest from Madison Wisconsin, and came out to live in Seattle about two years ago with my wife Olivia seeking new opportunities in life.

        I have a diverse background and have enjoyed a few different vocations.  One of my favorite experiences was being a meteorologist on a navy vessel for several years while stationed in Japan.

        Toward the end of my Navy career I embarked as an entrepreneur and started working an an e-commerce project with some of my closest friend.  I enjoyed a bit of success in this venture and had opportunities to train and work with people all over the world.

        I am now looking to the future and my life in the coding universe.  I know this skill will open up opportunities that otherwise will not be available to me.  My goal is to use the skills I learn at Code Fellows to enhance my employ-ability and become a stronger entrepreneur.</p>
